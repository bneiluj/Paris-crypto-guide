* [**Status**](https://status.im/)

Status is an open source mobile client for interacting with Ethereum. The app has native features, such as chat and wallet, but most importantly it enables users to access the rapidly emerging ecosystem of decentralized apps \(or DApps\) directly from their phone.

With the emergence of Ethereum and blockchain technology, a huge global movement is being fostered towards building the next generation of the internet.

This technology removes the need for middlemen and trusted third-parties, and edges us towards a world where users get to own their own data, and people can transact and communicate freely and securely.
