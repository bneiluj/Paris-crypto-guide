* **What?** The [Community Blockchain Week](https://blockchainweek.fr/) is a blockchain tech-focused initiative organized voluntarily by the community, with [**EthCC**](http://ethcc.io/) as a flagship event.

* **When?** The 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th March 2019

* **Where?** In Paris,  at the [CNAM](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Conservatoire+national+des+arts+et+métiers/@48.866746,2.3466766,15z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1scnam!3m4!1s0x47e66e0556a60823:0x46dad820509383bc!8m2!3d48.866746!4d2.3554313) and various [other locations](https://blockchainweek.fr/).

* **Who is behind this?**  
  [**ASSETH**](https://www.asseth.fr/en/home/) organizes EthCC with the support of the Ethereum Foundation and the CNAM.  
  Asseth is a regulated French non-profit organization. It hosts free Ethereum workshops several times a month since early 2016, feeds [the Ethereum France website](https://www.ethereum-france.com/) and translates technical papers in French. Asseth also participates to various educational projects and [open-source projects](https://github.com/asset/).  
  We initiated the [Community Blockchain Week](https://blockchainweek.fr/) but it is organized by the French crypto community.

* A huge thanks to the past [Sponsors ](/sponsors.md)of EthCC who made this event a reality.  
  We are still looking for sponsors for the 2019 edition!
