* \[**SOF'S BAR**\]\([http://www.sofsbar.fr/\](http://www.sofsbar.fr/\)\), 43 Rue Saint-Sauveur, 75002. The first place to accept Bitcoin and the beloved den of the cryptocommunity in Paris
* \[**Mezcaleria**\] - Mexican Mezcal and snacks  
  \([https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Attraction\_Review-g187147-d7363111-Reviews-La\_Mezcaleria-Paris\_Ile\_de\_France.html](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Attraction_Review-g187147-d7363111-Reviews-La_Mezcaleria-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\); 13 Boulevard du Temple, 75003

* \[**Le 153**\] - Mexican Mezcal and snacks \([https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant\_Review-g187147-d8310328-Reviews-Le\_153-Paris\_Ile\_de\_France.html\](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d8310328-Reviews-Le_153-Paris_Ile_de_France.html\)\); 153 Rue Saint-Martin, 75003

* \#\#\#Ménilmontant/Belleville \(farther away\)

* Travel guides usually describe these areas as "cosmopolitan and colorful," which basically means they're filled with Asian grocery stores and sports bars owned by immigrants. For the story, Fox News dubbed the place a “No Go Zone” before giving proper excuses. Everyone's realized they're the best place for cheap drinks and good atmosphere. On the Boulevard de Ménilmontant you'll easily find bars serving pints for €4.

* \[CAFÉ CHERIE\]\([https://fr-fr.facebook.com/cafe.cherie/\](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/cafe.cherie/\)\) 44 Boulevard de la Villette, 75019 Friendly, cheap and cheerful, with people in their thirties and lots of students from abroad. The place hosts a “blind test” \(music quiz\) every Wednesday. Definitely a go to if you are in the neighborhood.

\#**A note on Alcohol:**

**I**t is ok to drink/buy drinks if you are 18 and over. Most of the places where you can have food also sells something to drink \(wine or beer\). You might think that being in France is a good opportunity to drink good wine and honestly it is, just don’t expect a random café or bar to sell quality wine see the “bar à vins” section of this guide instead. Anyway your best bet is usually to go for the beer or try the French beer mix: sour orange and beer “picon bière”.

Drinking in the street is tolerated but people will probably look down on you. Being drunk in the street is quite tolerated as long as you don’t bother anyone, otherwise the Police can arrest you for “ivresse manifeste sur la voie publique” \(obvious drunk behavior on the public street\).
